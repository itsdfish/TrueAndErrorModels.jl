# Turing Models

TrueAndErrorModels.jl ships with off-the-shelf Turing models as described in Birnbaum, & Quispe-Torreblanca, (2018). The models become available when Turing is loaded into your current Julia session along with TrueAndErrorModels. The models have the following naming convention: The prefixes `tet` and `eut` correspond to True and Error Theory and Expected Utility Theory, respectively. The number corresponds to the number of error parameters. More details can be found in API.md.

## True and Error Theory Models

1. tet1_model
2. tet2_model
3. tet4_model


## Expected Utility Theory Models

1. eut1_model
2. eut2_model
3. eut4_model
